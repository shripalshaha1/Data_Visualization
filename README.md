# Data_Visualization
This data visualization project aimed to analyze the leading causes of death across countries over time. The datasets were sourced from Kaggle and included information on deaths due to air pollution, child mortality, dietary habits, health conditions, and lifestyle choices. Key visualizations were created in Tableau to gain insights into death rates across various parameters. The analysis showed that globally air pollution caused deaths increased by 58% from 1990-2014, with Asia being most affected. Child mortality reduced by 70% from 1990-2014. Deaths due to high blood pressure were the highest among health issues. The project involved aggregating multiple datasets, data wrangling using Tableau, and creating interactive dashboards to convey trends and insights effectively. The visualizations provided a comparative analysis of deaths across years, regions, and income levels. The results summarize key factors leading to mortality and can help guide policy decisions to improve health outcomes.
